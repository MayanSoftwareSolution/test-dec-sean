## Kinetic Recruitment Test -  Sean Bezuidenhout

Overview

- Framework Laravel.
- Version: 11.x
- PHP Version: 8.3
- Date 05/12/2024

## Introduction

- This is a Laravel application that calculates the distance of a geographic co-ordinates distance within the geo fence or its proximity to it.
- The application uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two points on the Earth's surface.
- The application also supports variable accuracy thresholds for the distance calculation.
- The application also supports efficient boundary proximity checking for geographic coordinates.
- The application has been tested with various test scenarios to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- Laravel was used as the framework to support my ability to create a quick and efficient solution. Additionally the framework follows well with the advertised job descrition.
- The code provided does not use laravel specific features, but rather uses the framework to provide a quick and efficient solution.
